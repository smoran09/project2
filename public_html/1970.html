                <h4><u><strong>Arpanet</strong></u></h4>
                <strong>ARPANET</strong>, known as <strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency Network,</strong> became
                the foundation for the internet by using the packet-switching technology.
                <ul>
                    <li>It's initial purpose was to link different computers at research institutions over telephone
                        lines. The
                        goal was to fix the circuit-switching technology.
                    </li>
                    <li>It made it easy for people to connect with each other and effectively communicate. 37 computers
                        connected over USA to
                        create the backbone of ARPAnet, comprised of UCLA, MIT, Stanford research institute , etc..
                    </li>
                    <li> According to Britannica, Paul Baran, a researcher at the RAND Corporation, was the first to
                        introduce the idea of packet switching.
                        He was designing a computer communication's network that would survive a nuclear attack and
                        still function. Baran came up with the process, that he called "hot potato routing",which later
                        became known as packet switching.

                <strong>Vincent Cerf and Robert Kahn,</strong> an american internet pioneer and electrical engineer,
                first met in UCLA,
                and later collaborated on the design of software called the <strong>Transmission Control
                Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).</strong>
                Together, they created the architecture of the internet. The TCP/IP protocol was a set of rules for
                message formats to allow computers and applications to exchange information.
                These rules were standardized and had to be followed in order for the host to be able to understand the
                message.
                Today, Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn are known as “Fathers of the Internet”. They focused on finding a way
                to get all computers to talk to each other and figured out a way to get
                networks to send packets back and forth.

                <h4><u><strong>IP and DNS</strong></u></h4>
                <strong>IP</strong> introduced the basic system of numerical addresses. An address such as 129.89.43.5
                identifies the
                computer to which a data packet should be sent to and the network on which it can be found. However,
                ARPAnet users were used to specifying computers by name or email addresses. Thus, a new domain name
                system (DNS) and TCP/IP protocols replaced the old ARPAnet- connected computers. In the
                <strong>DNS</strong>, high-level
                domains had functional codes such as .gov, .edu, .mil, or national codes such as .uk, .usa.
                Organizations received domain names ending in .edu, or .com. These domain names covered the assigned
                numerical IP addresses associated with individual computers.
