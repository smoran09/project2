                <h4>Entertainment Opportunities</h4>
                David Weekly, Cabel Sasser, and Justin Frankel, knew the connection of PC’s and the web led to new opportunities in entertainment, such as music in the form of MP3 online.
                In Boston, MA, Fanning created Napster.
                <ul>
                    <li> The code was written in June 1999, and by October 1999, Napster took over 75-80% of bandwidth of universities. It became popularly known as the fastest spreading software. </li>
                    <li> Rosen was a record label protector. </li>
                    <li> Howard King and Peter Paterno were lawyers in Hollywood. </li>

                    <li> This boosted Napster’s popularity and ended with Metallica looking bad.</li>
                    <li> Rosen and the IRAA filed a lawsuit for copyright and in July 2001, Napster shutdown.</li>

                <h4>Social Networking</h4>
