                <h4>Black Friday</h4>
                In Washington, D.C., Greenspan believed technology created a new economy.
                Between February and March 2000, interest rates increased.
                On April 14th 2000, Black Friday occurred, the NASDAQ fell, and the stock market collapsed. Following,
                after 18 months the September 11th attacks occurred.
                <ul>
                    <li> NASDAQ lost 2/3rds of its value.</li>
                    <li> Henry Blodget was found guilty of security fraud and was banned for life from securities.</li>
                    <li> eBay and Amazon survived. Andy Grove, creator of Intel, believed that the bubble was good and
                        allowed for new companies created to be durable.

                <h4>Communications Uprising</h4>

                <h4>Entertainment Opportunities</h4>
                David Weekly, Cabel Sasser, and Justin Frankel, knew the connection of PC’s and the web led to new
                opportunities in entertainment, such as music in the form of MP3 online.
                In Boston, MA, Fanning created Napster.
                <ul>
                    <li> The code was written in June 1999, and by October 1999, Napster took over 75-80% of bandwidth
                        of universities. It became popularly known as the fastest spreading software.
                    </li>
                    <li> Rosen was a record label protector.</li>
                    <li> Howard King and Peter Paterno were lawyers in Hollywood.</li>
                    <li> On May 3rd, 2000, King, Paterno, and the drummer from Metallica had an encounter with Napster.
                        They wanted the users to be banned who were breaking copyrighting laws.
                    </li>
                    <li> This boosted Napster’s popularity and ended with Metallica looking bad.</li>
                    <li> Rosen and the IRAA filed a lawsuit for copyright and in July 2001, Napster shutdown.</li>
                    <li> This event led to Steve Jobs, Apple, to create iTunes.</li>

                    <li> Craigslist offered free classifieds which was bad for publishers. Craig Newmark believed the
                        web was about setting communication free.
